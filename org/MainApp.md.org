This application handles the interaction with the web clients. It
receives tweets via subscribing to a Redis Pub/Sub and distributes them
to the connected clients when there's a match between the query of a
client and a new incoming tweet.

There can be multiple instances of this application, allowing the entire
system to be horizontally scalable.
