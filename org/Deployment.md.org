* Deployment
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: deployment
  :END:

In this chapter, we will have a look at potential deployment strategies,
for example by running the individual parts in separate Docker
containers on one or more host machines, or by deploying through an
application server.

** Docker Containers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: docker-containers
   :END:

My initial excitement for Docker has somewhat cooled down -- it is
certainly not the cure for all as I had erroneously assumed some time
ago, and it has caused me some anger in the past few months. But Docker
still has some positive sides, and there are ways to make your
experience when running your application inside a Docker container
smoother.

** Wildfly / Deploying a WAR file
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: wildfly-deploying-a-war-file
   :END:

I've recently experimented with running the BirdWatch application in a
WildFly application server, with great success. There's something quite
nice about using functionality from such an application server, such as
content compression or TLS, with no more than simply adding some
configuration, rather than having to implement all that yourself.
