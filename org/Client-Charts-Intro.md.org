** Charts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: charts

In this chapter, we will have a look at the charts displayed on the
right side in the UI, namely the *time series chart*, the *word count
chart*, and the *word cloud*. Before we do that, we will have a look at
the namespaces that are responsible for the *count statistics* and *data
aggregation*. The charts receive their data just like the UI elements,
i.e.Â by subscribing to the application state snapshots, only that the
data is reasoned about less frequently as it wouldn't make sense to run
the computations 50 times a second. Once per second or once every few
seconds is enough.

In fact, two of the three charts are implemented using
*[[https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent][Reagent]]* as well, with
the difference that we are not constructing HTML but *SVG*, which is
then mounted in the DOM. Only the word cloud uses
*[[http://d3js.org][D3.js]]*. The word count bar chart does some local
*linear regression* as well, but let's start from the top in the UI,
with the time series chart.
