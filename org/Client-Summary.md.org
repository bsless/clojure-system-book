While working on this chapter, I rewrote the client-side architecture in
a way that I believe will be much easier to reason about than before.
*Core.async* really is a great way to decouple different parts of an
application, and I am more convinced about that than ever.

Now, me finding this architecture sane and easy to reason about is one
thing, but how about you? Do you actually find the new architecture easy
to follow and generally sane? After making it this far in the book, you
should be in a great position to give me some feedback. Can you please
send me an email answering one or more of the following questions?

- Does the architecture make sense to you?
- Were you able to follow the code and explanations?
- What would you do differently?
- Is there anything that annoys you about this book?

Any additional feedback is welcome as well. Much appreciated, thank you!
Here's my address:

As the server-side and client-side chapters are written and ready for
review and comments, I can now take the architecture for a spin. I want
to do load tests and also implement a couple of additional features.
Let's see if the application performs well under load and if it is easy
to add features.

Thanks for reading this book and thank you for your feedback! Matthias
