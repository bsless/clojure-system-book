## User Interface

### React.js, Immutable Data and Reagent
**[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)** is a revolutionary way to build user interfaces. Its model is particularly well suited for working with immutable data structures because it is based on rendering out the entire application state every single time something changes. Unlike other frameworks, it does not require a mutation of your application state itself. React will then render the state into a virtual DOM, always keep the previous version of the virtual DOM and run an efficient diffing algorithm between the two. It will only change the actual and slow DOM where it has found changes between the previous and the current virtual DOM during the diffing phase.

This may at first sound inefficient but it is actually very fast, making it trivial to achieve 60 frames per second in the browser in most cases. As far as I know, **[David Nolen](https://twitter.com/swannodette)** was the first who realized how well this model is suited for working with ClojureScript's immutable data structures. He then developed **[Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om)**, which he first announced in this **[blog post](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/)**. Kudos to him for this discovery. At that time I was working on an **[AngularJS](http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-UI-Development-Amit-Ghart-ebook/dp/B00OXVAK7A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420394659&sr=8-1)** book and reading his blog post made me realize that AngularJS is not the way to go, at least not for me. I had already been exposed to functional programming principles enough to know the value of working with immutable values. Luckily, the publisher found a co-author as I didn't want to spend another couple of months with AngularJS.

I wrote the first version of the ClojureScript client using **Om**, but I always had the problem that I needed a rather large amount of context when coming back to the code for the user interface. I then discovered **[Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent)**, which also uses **React.js** and is based on the same principles as Om. 

I found the required code for a Reagent component to be much more succinct and legible so that I made a complete switch. A good part of the reason here is that I like its **[Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)** syntax.

Now when I come back to the UI code, I scratch my head a lot less than with the previous version. I shared the experience I read in this **[blog post](http://diogo149.github.io/2014/10/19/om-no/)**, which made me give Reagent a shot. I haven't regretted it. Reagent exposes a lot less incidental complexity than Om, and that just works better with my tiny brain. For more information on Reagent I can also recommend this **[blog post](http://getprismatic.com/story/1405451329953)**, besides the decent enough documentation of the project itself.

I will not start with an introduction to Reagent here as the previously mentioned resources should have you covered. Instead, I will just explain the code, which you actually may find simple enough without consulting many other resources. If some of it looks too simple to be true, no worries, it really is not.
