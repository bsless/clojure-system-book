## Charts
In this chapter, we will have a look at the charts displayed on the right side in the UI, namely the time series chart, the wordcount chart and the word cloud. Before we can do that, we will have a look at the namespaces that are responsible for the count statistics and data aggregation. The charts receive their data just like the UI elements did, by subscribing to the application state snapshots, only that the data is reasoned about less frequently. 

In fact, two of the three charts are implemented using **[Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent)** as well, with the difference that we are not constructing HTML but **SVG**, which is then mounted in the DOM. Only the word cloud uses **[D3.js](http://d3js.org)**. The word count bar chart in addition does some local linear regression as well, but let's start from the top in the UI, with the time series chart.
