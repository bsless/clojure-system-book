# Building a System in Clojure

In this book, we will build a system in Clojure that processes streaming data and visualizes different insights into the data in a browser. All visualizations of data display information in (near) real-time.

The sample implementation that we will use is the **[BirdWatch](https://github.com/matthiasn/BirdWatch)** application, a project I have started in Scala with AngularJS on the client side but that I have then switched over to an all-Clojure/ClojureScript implementation.

Over the course of this book, we will follow the data and explore parts of the system in the same order that the streaming data flows through the system.

There has been a series of articles that attempted to explain different aspects of the system, but I think that a book is a much better artifact to work on than a series of blog articles.

Please join me on this journey as I explore the problem further and at the same time attempt to write a book about it. I will make this content freely available. Please sign up as a reader, check out if you find the content at all useful and discuss where see better solutions. Only if you a) find the content helpful and b) you can afford it, I'd ask you to pay the recommended price (or whatever other amount you find appropriate). I am looking forward to a fun project and a lively discussion about all aspects of building a system in Clojure.

Cheers,
Matthias
