# Did you like the sample chapter?

If you did, please consider buying the full book on **[leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure)** if you'd like to find out how the remaining parts of the application work together. Currently, the server side is fully explained, with the client side following soon. I expect the current version of the client-side application to be fully described in January 2015.

Once that is done, we will look at the performance characteristics of the application, figure out how much load it can handle and then look at ways of improving the architecture.

In the case that you don't like the book, you are eligible for a full refund in the first 45 days. Or, preferably, you let me know which part you didn't like or find good enough and I try to make it better. There's a **[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/building-a-system-in-clojure)** for that.

Cheers,
Matthias
