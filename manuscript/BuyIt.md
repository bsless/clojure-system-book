# Did you like the sample chapters?

If you did, please consider buying the full book on **[leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure)** if you'd like to find out how the remaining parts of the application work together.

In the case that you don't like the book, you are eligible for a full refund in the first 45 days. Or, preferably, you let me know which part you didn't like or find good enough and I try to make it better. There's a **[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/building-a-system-in-clojure)** for that, or you write an email to me.

Cheers,
Matthias
