# Server-side Conclusion

In the previous chapters, I have outlined an architecture that I at the time of writing believed to be appropriate to meet the requirements. Now, some time later, I'm naturally sceptical and want to put this design to the test. Before we can do that, I will describe the client side. But once that's done, I will try to come up with load testing strategies so that we'll have a much better idea what this architecture can do. How many simultaneous clients can it handle, for example? I have no idea but I can't wait to find out.
