# Server-side Conclusion

In the previous chapters, I have outlined an architecture that I at the time of writing believed to be appropriate to meet the requirements. Now, some time later, I'm naturally sceptical and want to put this design to the test. 

I will have to describe the client side first though so we get a better understanding of the entire application. Expect further work on the client-side chapters in January 2015.

Once that's done, I will try to come up with load testing strategies so that we'll have a much better idea what this architecture can do. How many simultaneous clients can it handle, for example? I have no idea but I can't wait to find out.
