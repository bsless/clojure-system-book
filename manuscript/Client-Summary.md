## Summary
During the last three or four weeks, I rewrote the client-side architecture in a way that I believe to be much easier to reason about than before. **Core.async** really is a great way to decouple different parts of an application.

Now I didn't have anyone to ask if the new architecture is indeed easy to follow and generally sane. But if you've made it this far, you are in a great position to give me some feedback. Can you please send me an email answering one or more of the following questions?

* Does the architecture make sense to you? 
* Were you able to follow the code and explanations?
* What would you do differently?
* Is there anything that annoys you about this book?

Much appreciated, thank you! Here's my address: <matthias.nehlsen@gmail.com>

Now that the server-side and the client-side chapters are written and ready for review and comments, I can now take the architecture for a spin. I want to do load tests and also implement a couple of additional features. Let's see if the application performs well under load and if it is easy to add features.

Thanks for reading this book and thank you for your feedback!
