### Pure.css

Earlier versions of this application used **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)** as the CSS framework, including earlier versions of the Clojure / ClojureScript implementation. But after about a year, I really couldn't stand the Bootstrap look any longer. Sure, I could have changed stuff to make it look less like Bootstrap, but then why use Bootstrap in the first place. Here's how that old version looked like:

Bootstrap has served me alright over the last two years or so, but it was time for something simpler and cleaner.

So, I looked for newer CSS frameworks and found **[Pure](http://purecss.io)**. Pure is much more lightweight than Bootstrap, requires a much smaller download and its grid model is also easier to use than Bootstrap. Here's how the new version looks like:

I think this looks fresher than the old version. At the same time it also works much better on small mobile screens without much customization. In the iOS Simulator for the iPhone 6 Plus, for example, it looks like this:

Now it not only looks better, the HTML needed to generate this is also a lot simpler. Let's have a quick look at the HTML:

{lang="HTML"}

<body>
    <div class="header">
        <div class="home-menu pure-menu pure-menu-open pure-menu-horizontal pure-menu-fixed">
            <a class="pure-menu-heading" href="">Birdwatch</a>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/Birdwatch" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>

            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-wrapper">
        <div class="l-box">
            <div id="count">Tweets: <span id="tweet-count"></span></div>
            <div id="search"></div>
            <div id="pagination"></div>
            <div id="sort-buttons"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-g">
            <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-sm-1-2 pure-u-lg-5-12 l-box">
                <div id="tweet-frame"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-sm-1-2 pure-u-lg-7-12 l-box">
                <div id="timeseries1" class="timeseries"></div>
                <hr />
                <div id="wordCloud" class="cloud" ></div>
                <hr />
                <h5>word frequency</h5>
                <div id="wordcount-barchart" class="barchart" ></div>
                <hr />
                <div id="users-count"></div>
                <div id="total-tweet-count"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Scripts omitted -->
</body>

I like ***[Pure](http://purecss.io)** for the simplicity of its grid model. Although this is not a book about HTML and CSS, let's still walk through the HTML as it comes in handy when you want to design a web application.

In the _header_ ````div````, we create another ````div````. We assign it a couple of classes for styling and place a few elements inside, like an unordered list for links we want to have in the menu bar.

Next comes the actual content of the page, which we find inside a ````div````  assigned the _content-wrappper_-class. In there, we first have a ````div```` with class _l-box_, which gives us a little bit of padding:

{lang="CSS"}
~~~
.l-box {
  padding: 1em 1em 0 1em;
}
~~~

Inside, we place ````div````s with the IDs _tweet-count_, _search_, _pagination_ and _sort-buttons_. These are the IDs we render the respective components into using Reagent, remember?

Next, we have a ````div```` with class _pure-g_. This contains two ````div````s. One of them contains the list of tweets whereas the other one contains all the charts. Pure now gives us a straightforward way of defining a responsive grid, where the width of each is a fraction of the whole depending on the size of the screen.

On very small screens, both of them will have ````pure-u-1```` applied, where both have the full width of the screen and are thus stacked on top of each other.

On slightly larger screens (e.g. an iPhone 6 in landscape orientation), they will each occupy half of the width by having _pure-u-sm-1-2_ applied.

On even larger screens, such as desktops or tablets, the tweets will claim 5/12 of the space _pure-u-lg-5-12_ and the charts will claim 7/12 of the space _pure-u-lg-7-12_. That's all there really is to know about the containers provided by Pure. Inside, we can render whatever, for example Reagent components or an SVG generated by D3.js as we will see later when we look at the word cloud.
