# Load Testing and Optimization

In this part of the book, we shall determine performance baselines, optimize obvious performance bottlenecks and implement a load testing strategy so that we obtain a good understanding about how the system performs under load. Once we are able to generate load, we can also have a look at optimizing the environment, for example for reasonable garbage collection behavior in which the system does not become unnecessarily unresponsive.
