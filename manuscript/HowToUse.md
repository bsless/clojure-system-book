# How to use this Book

It's actually pretty straightforward. In a typical chapter you will find code snippets which usually contain an entire namespace because, why not. It's not that we're lacking space, and a little context never hurt anyone. Then typically, in the sentence before the code, you will find a link to the actual source file, at the commit when the following code was captured.

Next, the code will typically be explained. If you think that the explanation sucks, isn't clear, could be better or whatever, I'd ask you to please post that insufficiency on the **[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/building-a-system-in-clojure)** associated with the writing process of this book and I will try to improve it. This is all a work in progress.

That's all, really. 

**Have fun.**
