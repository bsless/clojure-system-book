# How to use this Book  -- Update February 2016

It's been a while that I was last able to put some creative thought into this book, and there are some reasons for that. Probably the most important one being the lack of a "traditional" publisher. When I first heard about LeanPub, I thought, what a great idea to let the readers provide feedback and thus replace the editor. But I haven't found that to work very well, especially not while doing rather demanding consulting work at the same time. It seems to be an unfortunate reality of life that usually the loudest voice gets heard and served first, and with little feedback from you, dear readers, I didn't get around to doing much on this front at all.

So please, if you want new content more often, please do provide some feedback and don't think, hey, someone else will do it. Also, while occasional praise may be kind, I'm more looking for constructive criticism. It's sweet that I have received some positive feedback, but of the aforementioned constructive criticism, I so far have received exactly zero. So, please, save time on messages that are only compliments, they aren't actionable in any way and instead tell me where there's room for improvement. I'll also be happy to set up a call with you if you need clarifications on any topic. Please send me an email to <matthias.nehlsen@gmail.com> and we can take it from there. Even if you have nothing particular to say other than that you're reading the book, I will still be happy to hear from you.

As an additional incentive for getting in touch with me, I will write little teasers for future chapters. When you find any of those particularly interesting, you can get that chapter earlier by letting me know. I **need** and appreciate your feedback.

That's all. 

**Have fun.**
